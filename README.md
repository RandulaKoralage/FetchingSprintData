# Fetching Sprint Data

This project is used to extract data from 4 opensource JIRA repositories, for my final year project in 2020. It can extract all sprints of a given project, all stories of a given project. The output is written into text files. These text files need to further process using a suitable tool and then can convert to comma-separated .csv files.

This POC is for Academic Purposes. Please refer the <a href="https://github.com/RandulaKoralage/FetchingSprintData/wiki"> wiki</a> for further details.
